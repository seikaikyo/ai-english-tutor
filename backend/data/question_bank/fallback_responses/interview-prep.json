    "user_example": "Can you tell me about the role?",
    "response": "Sure thing! So this role is about working with the team to tackle key challenges in our domain. You'd be collaborating across functions, contributing to projects that have real impact, and growing your skills in a hands-on environment. We're looking for someone who's curious, proactive, and excited to make a difference. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?"

    "user_example": "What does your company do exactly?",
    "response": "Great question! We're a technology company focused on building products that solve real problems for our customers. Our team combines engineering, design, and domain expertise to deliver solutions at scale.

    "user_example": "Who would I be working with on the team?",
    "response": "You'd be part of a cross-functional team that includes engineers, product managers, and domain specialists. It's a collaborative setup - everyone has visibility into how projects are progressing, and there's plenty of opportunity to learn from people with different backgrounds.

    "user_example": "What does a typical day look like in this role?",
    "response": "Honestly it varies a lot, which is part of what makes it interesting. Some days you're heads-down on project work - building, analyzing, or problem-solving. Other days you're in meetings with teammates, reviewing progress, or brainstorming new approaches. There's also time for documentation and knowledge sharing. No two weeks look the same, and there's room to shape the role based on your strengths."

    "response": "We're pretty open on the specific background, honestly. The strongest candidates we've seen bring a mix of technical skills and soft skills - things like analytical thinking, clear communication, and the ability to learn quickly. Relevant domain experience is definitely helpful, but we also value diverse perspectives. Being able to work independently while staying aligned with team goals is essential.

    "response": "After this conversation, if things look promising on both sides, the next step would be a technical interview with members of the team. That session usually involves a practical exercise related to the role. After that, there's a final interview focused on culture fit and working style. The whole process usually wraps up within two to three weeks. Does that timeline work for you?"

    "response": "We're a pretty direct, low-bureaucracy team. People here are expected to have opinions and contribute ideas - we value intellectual honesty and open communication. We support flexible work arrangements, and async communication is a big part of how we operate. There are regular team events to stay connected. People tend to be self-directed and we try to minimize unnecessary meetings. Does that kind of setup appeal to you?"

    "response": "That's great to hear you're thinking ahead! Ideally we'd like someone who can start within four to six weeks. We understand that most people have notice periods and we want to make sure you wrap up your current role properly. If you need a bit more time, we can usually be flexible. Is there anything on your end that might affect your availability to start?"
