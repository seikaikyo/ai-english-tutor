    "response": "**Explanation: How to Identify the Right Answer in Part 6**\n\nWhen a blank appears in a Part 6 passage, use this three-step approach:\n\n**Step 1 — Identify the grammatical role**\nAsk: Is the blank a verb, noun, adjective, or adverb? Look at what comes before and after.\n- After \"a\" / \"the\" / \"an\" → noun or adjective + noun\n- After a linking verb (is, are, was, were, become) → adjective or past participle\n- Before a noun → adjective\n- Modifying a verb, adjective, or other adverb → adverb\n\n**Step 2 — Check the verb structure**\nFor verb blanks, ask four questions:\n1. Active or passive? (Does the subject do the action, or receive it?)\n2. Singular or plural subject? (Affects verb agreement)\n3. What time frame? (Tense signal words: yesterday, currently, next month)\n4. After a modal or auxiliary? (Must use base form after will/can/should/to)\n\n**Step 3 — Read the sentence meaning**\nAfter narrowing by grammar, select the word that makes logical sense in context. Part 6 tests vocabulary within grammar constraints — both must fit.\n\n**Common traps:**\n| Trap | Example | Fix |\n|------|---------|-----|\n| Adjective vs. adverb | strict / strictly | Check what it modifies |\n| Active vs. passive | has sent / has been sent | Check subject's role |\n| Wrong preposition in phrase | in accordance to | Memorize fixed phrases |\n| Singular/plural verb | is enclosed / are enclosed | Find the subject first |"

    "response": "**TOEIC Part 6 Strategies — Seven Essential Tips**\n\n**1. Read the entire passage first (30 seconds)**\nDo not fill in blanks on the first read. Understanding the passage's topic, tone, and purpose prevents you from selecting a grammatically correct but contextually wrong answer.\n\n**2. Identify the text type**\nEmails, memos, and letters follow predictable structures. Knowing the structure helps you predict what kind of word is likely missing (e.g., email closings often test polite verb phrases like \"do not hesitate to contact\").\n\n**3. Check the four answer choices before the blank**\nIf all four options are forms of the same word (confirm / confirmed / confirming / confirmation), you are dealing with a word form question. Go straight to grammar rules.\n\n**4. Watch for fixed phrases and collocations**\nPart 6 frequently tests whether you know standard business expressions:\n- \"effective [date]\" (not \"effecting\")\n- \"in accordance with\" (not \"in accordance to\")\n- \"prior to\" (not \"prior than\")\n- \"do not hesitate to\" (not \"do not hesitate for\")\n\n**5. For conjunction blanks, understand the logic**\nHowever = contrast; Therefore = result; Moreover = addition; Otherwise = alternative condition. Read both clauses to determine the logical relationship.\n\n**6. For passive vs. active blanks, find the subject**\nAsk: is the subject doing the action or receiving it? If the subject is receiving the action, use passive voice (be + past participle).\n\n**7. Manage time: 2 minutes per passage**\nWith four passages of 3–4 questions each (12–16 questions total), budget roughly 2 minutes per passage. If one blank is uncertain, use context to eliminate two options and make a choice."

    "response": "**Part 6 Reading Strategy — A Step-by-Step Approach**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the document type (5 seconds)**\nLook at the format. Is it an email (To/From/Subject header)? A memo? A notice? A letter? An advertisement? Each type has a predictable structure that tells you what information to expect where.\n\n**Step 2: Read the full passage without stopping at blanks (30–40 seconds)**\nDo not pause at each blank. Read straight through, mentally substituting a placeholder word if needed. Your goal is to grasp the overall topic, the sender's purpose, and the logical flow of information.\n\n**Step 3: Categorize each blank (10 seconds per blank)**\nFor each blank, determine:\n- Word form question (four forms of one word) → apply grammar rules\n- Vocabulary question (four different words) → apply context meaning\n- Conjunction/transition question → analyze the logical relationship between sentences\n\n**Step 4: Use context beyond the sentence**\nPart 6 is more difficult than Part 5 because some blanks require understanding the paragraph or even the whole passage, not just the sentence with the blank. Watch for:\n- Time signals that determine tense\n- Subject agreement established in a previous sentence\n- Logical transitions that span paragraphs\n\n**Step 5: Eliminate before selecting**\nFor every blank, eliminate at least two options before committing. This reduces the chance of choosing an option that looks correct in isolation but fails grammatically or contextually.\n\n**Time target: 2 minutes per passage** (8 minutes total for Part 6, which has 4 passages)."

Skip the full re-read and focus only on the sentence containing the blank plus one sentence before and after.\n2. For word form questions (the most common type), go directly to grammar analysis without reading for meaning.\n3. Mark uncertain questions and return if time allows. Do not leave blanks; a guess is always better than no answer on the TOEIC.\n\n**Relative difficulty of Part 6 vs. Part 5:**\nPart 6 blanks are harder because context from the whole passage is required. If you can finish Part 5 in under 15 minutes, you will have enough reserve time for Part 6.\n\n**Recommended overall Reading section pacing:**\n- Part 5 (30 questions): 15 minutes\n- Part 6 (16 questions): 8 minutes\n- Part 7 (54 questions): 52 minutes\n- Buffer: 5 minutes\n\nIf Part 6 is consistently slow, practice reading business document types (emails, memos) in English daily to increase processing speed."

    "response": "**How to Improve Your TOEIC Part 6 Score**\n\n**1. Build business vocabulary systematically**\nPart 6 passages use formal business language. Focus on:\n- Email and memo language (\"please be advised,\" \"effective immediately,\" \"at your earliest convenience\")\n- Fixed collocations (\"in compliance with,\" \"subject to approval,\" \"on behalf of\")\n- Word families (compete / competitive / competition / competitively)\n\n**2. Master the top grammar points tested**\nPart 6 repeatedly tests the same grammar categories:\n- Verb tense and aspect (especially perfect and passive forms)\n- Active vs. passive voice\n- Word form (noun / verb / adjective / adverb)\n- Prepositions in fixed phrases\n- Conjunctions and transitions\n\nSpend 10–15 minutes per day drilling these specific areas.\n\n**3. Read authentic business documents**\nRead English business emails, corporate press releases, and news articles daily. This builds natural intuition for sentence structure and word choice that test questions cannot fully replicate.\n\n**4. Practice with timed full passages**\nAlways practice under timed conditions. Reading a passage and answering 4 questions in under 2 minutes is a skill that requires repetition.\n\n**5. Review wrong answers analytically**\nAfter each practice session, do not just note which answers were wrong. Ask: what grammatical rule or vocabulary gap caused the error? Keep an error log and review it weekly.\n\n**6. Realistic score milestones:**\n| Current Level | Realistic Improvement | Timeline |\n|---------------|-----------------------|----------|\n| 550–650 | +50–80 points | 2–3 months |\n| 650–750 | +30–50 points | 3–4 months |\n| 750–850 | +20–30 points | 4–6 months |"

    "response": "**Understanding Part 6 Difficulty Levels**\n\nPart 6 questions range across three difficulty tiers. Here is how to identify which level a blank is and what skill it tests:\n\n**Level 1 — Word Form (Most Common, ~40% of blanks)**\nAll four options are forms of the same root word.\nExample: organize / organized / organizing / organization\nSkill required: Identify grammatical role (noun/verb/adjective/adverb) from sentence structure.\nTip: These are the most learnable. Master the eight parts of speech and their typical positions.\n\n**Level 2 — Tense and Voice (~30% of blanks)**\nAll four options are forms of the same verb, but differ in tense, mood, or active/passive.\nExample: send / sent / will be sent / has been sending\nSkill required: Understand time frame from context, determine active vs. passive, check subject-verb agreement.\nTip: Find tense signal words in the passage (\"yesterday,\" \"currently,\" \"by next Friday\").\n\n**Level 3 — Conjunction and Transition (~15% of blanks)**\nOptions are different conjunctions or transition words.\nExample: However / Therefore / Moreover / Otherwise\nSkill required: Analyze the logical relationship between two sentences or clauses.\nTip: These require reading beyond the sentence. Always read the sentence before and after the blank.\n\n**Level 4 — Contextual Vocabulary (~15% of blanks)**\nOptions are four different words with different meanings but similar grammar.\nSkill required: Understanding precise word meaning in a business context.\nTip: Expand vocabulary through reading, not memorization lists alone.\n\nFor practice, the passages in this drill session are calibrated to mid-range TOEIC difficulty (approximately 650–750 band). Let me know if you want to adjust the level."
