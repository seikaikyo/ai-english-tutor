    "user_example": "Can you explain the answers?",
    "response": "Sure. Here is how to approach answer explanations for TOEIC Part 7.\n\n**How to verify your answers:**\n\n**Step 1 — Find the evidence in the text.**\nEvery correct answer to a detail question has direct support in the passage. Underline or highlight the sentence that supports your choice. If you cannot find it in the text, the answer is likely wrong.\n\n**Step 2 — Eliminate distractors.**\nTOEIC wrong answers often use words from the passage but change the meaning slightly. Watch for:\n- Answers that are true in general but not stated in the passage\n- Answers that reverse the meaning (e.g., \"reduced\" vs. \"increased\")\n- Answers that apply to the wrong person or time\n\n**Step 3 — Check inference questions carefully.**\n\"What can be inferred?\" means the answer is not stated directly. The correct choice is a logical conclusion based on what IS stated. Do not choose an answer that requires outside knowledge.\n\n**Step 4 — For vocabulary questions**, substitute each option into the original sentence and check which one preserves the original meaning.\n\nWould you like to try the next passage, or go over a specific question from the last one?"

    "user_example": "Where in the text is the answer?",
    "response": "For TOEIC Part 7, every detail question answer is grounded in a specific part of the passage. Here is how to locate it efficiently.\n\n**Locating answers quickly:**\n\n1. **Read the question stem first**, before re-reading the passage. Know exactly what you are looking for.\n\n2. **Use keywords from the question** to scan the passage. If the question asks about a deadline, scan for dates and numbers. If it asks about a person, scan for that name.\n\n3. **The answer is usually in one or two sentences.** TOEIC does not require you to synthesize the entire passage for detail questions — the evidence is local.\n\n4. **Watch for paraphrasing.** The passage might say \"the event was postponed to Thursday\" and the correct answer will say \"the meeting was rescheduled.\" The words differ, but the meaning matches.\n\n5. **For inference questions**, the supporting evidence is still in the text — you just need to draw a one-step logical conclusion from it. If multiple steps of reasoning are required, the answer is probably a distractor.\n\n**Practice tip:** After answering, always go back and physically point to the sentence in the passage that justifies your choice. If you cannot, reconsider your answer."

    "response": "Here are the most effective strategies for TOEIC Part 7.\n\n**Before you read the passage:**\n- Read all the questions first (takes 30–45 seconds)\n- Underline the key noun or verb in each question so you know what to look for\n- Note if there is a \"NOT mentioned\" question — those require checking all options\n\n**While reading the passage:**\n- Read the first sentence of each paragraph — it usually signals the topic\n- Do not read every word at full speed; scan for names, numbers, dates, and capitalized terms\n- Keep the questions in mind as you read — mark the section when you spot relevant information\n\n**Answering questions:**\n- Answer easy questions first; skip and return to harder ones\n- Eliminate options that contradict the passage outright\n- For vocabulary questions, replace the word with each option and see which fits the context\n- For inference questions, stay close to what the text actually says\n\n**Time management:**\n- Single-passage sets: about 2–3 minutes per set\n- Double/triple passage sets: 4–5 minutes per set\n- If a passage is very long, spend no more than 90 seconds reading before you go to the questions\n\nReady for the next passage?"

    "user_example": "Tell me about email passages",
    "response": "Email and letter passages are the most common type in TOEIC Part 7. Here is what to know.\n\n**What to look at first in an email passage:**\n1. **From/To fields** — Who sent it and who received it tells you the relationship (colleague, customer, manager, vendor)\n2. **Subject line** — This almost always reveals the main purpose\n3. **First body paragraph** — States the reason for writing\n4. **Last body paragraph** — Usually contains a request, deadline, or call to action\n\n**Common question types for emails:**\n- \"What is the purpose of this email?\" → Look at the subject line and first paragraph\n- \"What does the sender request?\" → Look at the final paragraph or any action items\n- \"What can be inferred about the recipient?\" → Combine the From/To fields with context clues\n- \"What should the reader do by [date]?\" → Scan for dates and imperative verbs\n\n**Watch out for:**\n- Emails with attachments mentioned (\"Please see the attached...\") — a question may ask what was enclosed\n- Conditional statements (\"If you have not received... please contact...\") — these often appear as detail questions\n- Polite softening language (\"I would like to...\" = the sender wants something specific)\n\nWould you like to practice with an email passage now?"

    "user_example": "What about advertisement passages?",
    "response": "Advertisement passages appear in every TOEIC Part 7 section. They fall into three main types: job postings, product ads, and service promotions.\n\n**Job Posting Ads — what to look for:**\n- Job title and company name (usually in the heading)\n- Requirements vs. responsibilities (two different sections — do not confuse them)\n- Application instructions: deadline, method, contact\n- Benefits listed (salary, remote options, bonuses)\n\n**Common questions:** What is one requirement for this position? What should applicants submit? What benefit does the company offer?\n\n**Product Ads — what to look for:**\n- Specific features and specs (numbers, dimensions, durations)\n- Limited-time offers or promotional conditions (\"before [date]\")\n- Where to purchase\n- Customer testimonials (often quoted at the end)\n\n**Common questions:** According to the ad, how long does X last? What will customers receive if...? What is NOT mentioned as a feature?\n\n**Service Promotion Ads — what to look for:**\n- Pricing tiers and what each includes (often in a table)\n- Introductory or switching offers\n- Contact information and next steps\n\n**General tip for all ads:** Every specific number (price, quantity, duration, percentage) is a potential detail question. Underline them as you read.\n\nReady to try an advertisement passage?"

    "user_example": "How do I handle double passage questions?",
    "response": "Double and triple passage questions appear in the final section of TOEIC Part 7 (questions 176–200 on the actual test). They work differently from single-passage questions.\n\n**What makes them different:**\n- You receive two or three related texts (e.g., an email + a schedule, or an article + a comment + a reply)\n- Some questions require information from only ONE document\n- Some questions require you to COMBINE information from two or more documents\n\n**How to approach them:**\n\n1. **Read the questions first** — check which document each question refers to. Some will say \"According to the first email...\" which tells you where to look.\n\n2. **Handle single-source questions first.** Answer any question that clearly refers to only one passage before tackling cross-reference questions.\n\n3. **For cross-reference questions**, identify what piece of information each passage contributes. Often one passage gives a name or date, and the other gives details about that name or date.\n\n4. **Do not assume.** Only use what is written in the texts. A common trap is choosing an answer that sounds logical but is not supported by either document.\n\n**Time allocation:** Budget 4–5 minutes for each double-passage set and 5–6 minutes for triple-passage sets. If you are behind on time, read only the questions and scan the passages rather than reading in full.\n\nWould you like to try a passage set now?"

    "user_example": "How do I scan passages faster?",
    "response": "Scanning is one of the most useful skills for TOEIC Part 7. Here is how to do it well.\n\n**Scanning vs. skimming:**\n- **Skimming** = reading quickly for general meaning (useful for getting the main idea)\n- **Scanning** = moving your eyes rapidly to find a specific piece of information (useful for detail questions)\n\nFor TOEIC, you will use both — skim first to understand the passage structure, then scan when answering specific questions.\n\n**Scanning technique:**\n1. Identify the target: what specific thing are you looking for? (a name, a date, a price, a condition)\n2. Move your eyes down the left side of the text in a zigzag or vertical pattern\n3. Stop only when you spot the type of information you are seeking\n4. Read 1–2 sentences around that spot carefully\n\n**What to scan for:**\n- Capitalized words (names, companies, places)\n- Numbers and dates\n- Words from the question stem (or their synonyms)\n- Transition words that signal key information: \"however,\" \"therefore,\" \"as a result,\" \"unless,\" \"if\"\n\n**Practice drill:** Look at a passage and give yourself 20 seconds to find all numbers in it. Then give yourself another 20 seconds to find all proper nouns. This trains your eye to move efficiently.\n\nReady to practice on a new passage?"

    "response": "Time management is one of the most common challenges in TOEIC Part 7. Here are the target pacing guidelines.\n\n**Total time for Part 7:** approximately 54–57 minutes (shared with Part 5 and 6, so finish those efficiently)\n\n**Recommended time per set type:**\n\n| Passage Type | Questions | Target Time |\n|---|---|---|\n| Single passage (short) | 2 questions | 2–2.5 minutes |\n| Single passage (medium) | 3 questions | 3–3.5 minutes |\n| Double passage | 5 questions | 4–5 minutes |\n| Triple passage | 5 questions | 5–6 minutes |\n\n**Per question:** roughly 45–75 seconds on average, but do not count per question — count per passage set.\n\n**Pacing strategy:**\n1. If you finish a set in under the target time, bank those seconds — you will need them later.\n2. If a single question is taking more than 60 seconds, mark your best guess and move on. You can return if time permits.\n3. Never leave a question blank — there is no penalty for wrong answers on the TOEIC.\n4. For the final 5 minutes, focus on completing all answers rather than perfecting individual ones.\n\n**Red flag:** If you reach the double-passage section with less than 20 minutes remaining, you need to increase your reading speed in Parts 5 and 6.\n\nShall we do a timed passage now?"

Improving Part 7 accuracy by 5–10 questions can raise your Reading score by 20–40 points.\n\n**Practical goal:** Aim for 80%+ accuracy in Part 7 (approximately 43+ correct out of 54) to achieve a Reading score in the 400+ range.\n\nReady to practice another passage?"
