In the simple present tense, third-person singular subjects require the verb to add '-s.' 'Present' (no -s) would match a plural subject like 'managers.' 'Presented' is past tense. 'Presenting' is a participle and cannot serve as the main verb without an auxiliary."

    "response": "---\n**Breaking Down TOEIC Part 5 Answers**\n\nEvery Part 5 question tests one specific grammar rule. Here is a fast framework to identify which rule is being tested:\n\n**Step 1 — Look at the answer choices first**\n\n| What you see | What is being tested |\n|---|---|\n| Four forms of the same root word (e.g., act / action / active / actively) | Word form (noun / verb / adjective / adverb) |\n| Same verb in different tenses | Verb tense or passive voice |\n| Different prepositions (in / on / at / by) | Preposition collocation |\n| Conjunctions (although / despite / however / because) | Connectors and conjunctions |\n| Who / whom / which / whose | Relative pronouns |\n\n**Step 2 — Read the sentence for clues**\n\nTime markers (yesterday, currently, by Friday) tell you the tense. Signal words like 'despite' or 'although' tell you the relationship between clauses.\n\n**Step 3 — Eliminate wrong options**\n\nYou do not need to be certain about the right answer — just rule out the three wrong ones.\n\nWould you like to try a practice question now?"

Do not spend more than 45 seconds on any single item — mark your best guess and move on.\n\n**Read choices before the sentence**\nScanning the four options first reveals the grammar point being tested. This lets you read the sentence with a targeted focus.\n\n**Identify the grammar category**\n\n| Category | Frequency on TOEIC |\n|---|---|\n| Word form | Very high |\n| Verb tense / voice | High |\n| Prepositions | High |\n| Conjunctions | Medium |\n| Subject-verb agreement | Medium |\n| Relative pronouns | Medium |\n| Conditionals | Lower |\n\n**Watch for distractors**\nTest writers use plausible-looking wrong answers. A word that sounds right is not always grammatically correct in context.\n\n**Know your collocations**\nFixed phrases like 'responsible for,' 'based on,' 'result in,' and 'prior to' appear repeatedly.

    "response": "---\n**Top 5 TOEIC Part 5 Mistakes**\n\n**1. Choosing the nearest noun as the subject**\nIn 'The quality of the reports is important,' the subject is 'quality' (singular), not 'reports.' Always find the true grammatical subject.\n\n**2. Confusing gerund vs. infinitive after verbs**\n- Gerund only: suggest, consider, avoid, enjoy, finish\n- Infinitive only: decide, plan, want, hope, need\n- Both (different meanings): stop, remember, forget\n\n**3. Using 'although' where 'despite' is needed (and vice versa)**\n- 'Although' + clause (subject + verb)\n- 'Despite' / 'In spite of' + noun phrase\n\n**4. Mixing up 'who' and 'whom'**\n- 'Who' = subject of the clause (who sent the email)\n- 'Whom' = object of the clause (whom we contacted)\n\n**5. Choosing adjective instead of adverb (or the reverse)**\nAdjectives modify nouns. Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Check what the blank is modifying, not just what sounds natural.\n\nShall I give you a question that targets one of these areas?"

The same grammar categories appear on every test:\n- Word form\n- Verb tense\n- Prepositions\n- Subject-verb agreement\n- Conjunctions\n\nOnce you recognize the category being tested, the correct answer becomes much clearer.\n\n**A realistic target**: Most test-takers improve their Part 5 accuracy by 5–8 questions within 4–6 weeks of focused daily practice (15–20 minutes per day).\n\n**What to do right now**: Pick one grammar category and drill it until it feels automatic. Then move to the next.\n\nOne question at a time. Say 'next question' whenever you are ready."
