    "situation": "Your colleague just gave a presentation and asks for your feedback. You think it was good but the pacing was too fast.",
    "example_response": "Great job on the presentation! The content was really solid. One thing I'd suggest is slowing down a bit during the key points so the audience has time to absorb them.",
    "response": "Situational response practice:\n\nSituation: Your colleague just gave a presentation and asks for your feedback. You think it was good but the pacing was too fast.\n\nHow would you respond?\n\nExample answer: Great job on the presentation! The content was really solid. One thing I'd suggest is slowing down a bit during the key points so the audience has time to absorb them.\n\nKey language tips: Use a compliment sandwich (positive - suggestion - positive). Phrases like 'one thing I'd suggest' or 'it might help to' soften constructive criticism. Avoid saying 'but' directly after praise - 'and' or 'one thing' feels less confrontational."

    "situation": "A friend invites you to a party on Saturday, but you already have plans you can't change. You want to decline without hurting their feelings.",
    "example_response": "I'd really love to come, but I'm afraid I already have something on this Saturday that I can't get out of. Can we catch up soon though? Maybe we could grab coffee next week?",
    "response": "Situational response practice:\n\nSituation: A friend invites you to a party on Saturday, but you already have plans you can't change. You want to decline without hurting their feelings.\n\nHow would you respond?\n\nExample answer: I'd really love to come, but I'm afraid I already have something on this Saturday that I can't get out of. Can we catch up soon though? Maybe we could grab coffee next week?\n\nKey language tips: 'I'd love to, but...' softens the refusal. 'I'm afraid' is a polite way to introduce bad news. Offering an alternative (coffee next week) shows you still value the friendship. Avoid vague excuses - they can come across as dishonest."

    "situation": "You arrive late to an important client meeting because of unexpected traffic. The clients are visibly irritated.",
    "example_response": "I sincerely apologize for keeping you waiting. There was an accident on the motorway that caused significant delays, and I should have left earlier to account for it. I appreciate your patience and I'm ready to give you my full attention now.",
    "response": "Situational response practice:\n\nSituation: You arrive late to an important client meeting because of unexpected traffic. The clients are visibly irritated.\n\nHow would you respond?\n\nExample answer: I sincerely apologize for keeping you waiting. There was an accident on the motorway that caused significant delays, and I should have left earlier to account for it. I appreciate your patience and I'm ready to give you my full attention now.\n\nKey language tips: A professional apology has three parts: acknowledge the impact, briefly explain (not excuse), and move forward. 'I sincerely apologize' is stronger than 'I'm sorry'. Taking some responsibility ('I should have left earlier') shows accountability even when the cause was external. Redirect quickly to the meeting itself."

    "situation": "You are negotiating your salary for a new job offer. The company's offer is 15% below your expectation. You want to counteroffer professionally.",
    "example_response": "Thank you so much for the offer - I'm genuinely excited about this opportunity. Based on my research into the market rate for this role and my seven years of experience, I was hoping we could get closer to a figure in the range of X. Is there any flexibility on the base salary?",
    "response": "Situational response practice:\n\nSituation: You are negotiating your salary for a new job offer. The company's offer is 15% below your expectation.

Based on my research into the market rate for this role and my seven years of experience, I was hoping we could get closer to a figure in the range of X. Is there any flexibility on the base salary?\n\nKey language tips: Always express enthusiasm before negotiating. Ground your ask in evidence ('market rate', 'years of experience') not personal need. Phrase your target as a range rather than a fixed number. End with a question ('Is there flexibility?') to keep dialogue open. Avoid apologizing for negotiating."

    "situation": "You meet someone at a professional networking event. You want to start a conversation and find common ground.",
    "example_response": "Hi, I don't think we've met - I'm Alex. What brings you to this event? Are you in the industry, or are you exploring a new field?",
    "response": "Situational response practice:\n\nSituation: You meet someone at a professional networking event.

Are you in the industry, or are you exploring a new field?\n\nKey language tips: Open-ended questions ('What brings you here?') are more effective than yes/no questions for starting conversations. Giving your name immediately makes the exchange feel natural. Following up with a choice question ('in the industry, or exploring?') makes it easy for the other person to respond. Avoid asking 'What do you do?' immediately - it can feel transactional."

    "situation": "You are interviewing for a job and the interviewer asks: 'What is your greatest weakness?'",
    "example_response": "I tend to take on too much ownership of a project and find it difficult to delegate. I've been actively working on this by setting clearer boundaries and trusting my team members with more responsibility. I've seen real improvement over the past year.",
    "response": "Situational response practice:\n\nSituation: You are interviewing for a job and the interviewer asks: 'What is your greatest weakness?'\n\nHow would you respond?\n\nExample answer: I tend to take on too much ownership of a project and find it difficult to delegate. I've been actively working on this by setting clearer boundaries and trusting my team members with more responsibility. I've seen real improvement over the past year.\n\nKey language tips: The classic structure is: name a genuine (but not disqualifying) weakness, explain what you are doing to address it, and note the progress. Avoid fake weaknesses like 'I work too hard'. Be specific and honest. The phrase 'actively working on this' shows self-awareness and initiative."

    "situation": "A customer contacts you to complain that an order arrived damaged and they want a refund immediately.",
    "example_response": "I'm really sorry to hear your order arrived in that condition - that's certainly not the experience we want for you. I'll arrange a full refund right away. Could you send us a photo of the damage for our records? You should see the refund within three to five business days.",
    "response": "Situational response practice:\n\nSituation: A customer contacts you to complain that an order arrived damaged and they want a refund immediately.\n\nHow would you respond?\n\nExample answer: I'm really sorry to hear your order arrived in that condition - that's certainly not the experience we want for you. I'll arrange a full refund right away. Could you send us a photo of the damage for our records? You should see the refund within three to five business days.\n\nKey language tips: Acknowledge the problem before explaining or asking questions. 'That's not the experience we want for you' takes ownership without excessive blame. Making the request for a photo feel like a formality ('for our records') rather than interrogation maintains goodwill. Always give a clear timeline so the customer knows what to expect."

    "situation": "You need to write a professional email declining a business proposal while keeping the relationship positive.",
    "example_response": "Thank you for taking the time to share this proposal with us. After careful consideration, we've decided not to move forward at this stage, as it doesn't align with our current priorities. We truly appreciate your effort and hope there may be opportunities to collaborate in the future.",
    "response": "Situational response practice:\n\nSituation: You need to write a professional email declining a business proposal while keeping the relationship positive.\n\nHow would you respond?\n\nExample answer: Thank you for taking the time to share this proposal with us. After careful consideration, we've decided not to move forward at this stage, as it doesn't align with our current priorities. We truly appreciate your effort and hope there may be opportunities to collaborate in the future.\n\nKey language tips: 'After careful consideration' signals that the decision was not hasty. 'At this stage' and 'current priorities' leave the door open without making promises. Avoid giving too much detail about why - it can invite pushback. A brief expression of appreciation keeps the relationship intact. Never leave the person wondering - be clear about the decision."

    "example_response": "I appreciate both of your perspectives here - it's clear you both care about getting this right. Let's take a step back and look at the data we have, then work through the options methodically. Maria, could you walk us through your main concern in two minutes, and then we'll hear from James?",
    "response": "Situational response practice:\n\nSituation: You are facilitating a meeting and two colleagues are beginning to argue. You need to de-escalate and redirect the discussion.\n\nHow would you respond?\n\nExample answer: I appreciate both of your perspectives here - it's clear you both care about getting this right. Let's take a step back and look at the data we have, then work through the options methodically. Maria, could you walk us through your main concern in two minutes, and then we'll hear from James?\n\nKey language tips: Validate both sides before redirecting - it reduces defensiveness. 'It's clear you both care' reframes conflict as shared commitment. 'Let's take a step back' is a neutral phrase that pauses momentum. Giving each person structured time ('two minutes') makes the process feel fair. As a facilitator, use 'we' language to keep the group unified."

The biggest shift for most people is moving from studying English to using English. Try watching TV shows without subtitles, journaling in English daily, or finding a conversation partner online. The goal is to get comfortable being uncomfortable with the language.\n\nKey language tips: Start by normalizing the problem ('that's common') to reduce anxiety. The phrase 'the good news is' pivots from problem to solution. Giving three concrete, actionable tips is more useful than general advice. Ending with a memorable principle ('comfortable being uncomfortable') makes the advice stick."
