The present perfect passive \"has been revised\" indicates the revision happened recently with a current result.\n- Q3 = 1. prior to — \"Prior to\" is a prepositional phrase meaning \"before.\" \"Prior than\" is grammatically incorrect; \"previously\" is an adverb that cannot precede a noun phrase; \"before of\" is non-standard."

During — \"During\" is the correct preposition to introduce a noun phrase time period (\"this period\"). \"While\" introduces a clause with a subject and verb. \"Throughout of\" is non-standard; the correct form is \"throughout\" alone.\n- Q3 = 3. are encouraged — The passive voice is needed because customers are being encouraged by the company. The subject \"Customers\" is plural, so \"is encouraged\" would be wrong.\n- Q4 = 3.
