    "explanation": "The subject is 'the number,' which is singular and takes a singular verb 'has.' A common error is treating 'complaints' (the noun after 'of') as the subject.

Singular subjects take singular verbs, so 'has' is correct. A key TOEIC rule: 'the number of + plural noun' = singular verb; 'a number of + plural noun' = plural verb. Do not be distracted by 'complaints,' which is part of the prepositional phrase, not the subject."

The if-clause uses 'fails,' so the main clause uses 'will terminate.' This structure describes a real or likely future outcome.

'Launch' (base form) and 'to launch' (infinitive) cannot modify a noun this way. 'Launching' would indicate the campaign was actively launching something, which changes the meaning.",

The full version is: 'The advertising campaign that was launched by the marketing team...' The past participle 'launched' (passive meaning) acts as an adjective modifying 'campaign.'

In the clause 'who have registered on the website,' 'who' acts as the subject performing the action of registering. 'Which' is for things.

    "explanation": "After verbs of request, demand, or recommendation (request, insist, suggest, recommend), English uses the subjunctive mood: 'that + subject + base verb.' The passive subjunctive is 'be + past participle,' so 'be settled' is correct. 'Are settled' (indicative) and 'settled' (past) do not follow this pattern.",

Because 'invoices' receive the action (passive), the structure is 'be + past participle' = 'be settled.' This pattern appears on TOEIC regularly.

The entire noun clause 'whoever had purchased...' acts as the object of the preposition 'to.' 'Whoever' (subject case) is correct because it is the subject inside the clause.

Inside the clause, 'whoever' acts as the subject of 'had purchased,' so the subject form is correct. Think of it this way: 'to [whoever had purchased]' = 'to [him/her who had purchased].'

'Widely' is the correct adverb, and its comparative form is 'more widely' (multi-syllable adverbs use 'more'). The word 'than' confirms a comparison between two items, ruling out the superlative 'most widely.' 'Wider' is an adjective and cannot modify a participle."

    "answer": "that",
    "explanation": "After verbs of requirement or demand (require, demand, insist, request), a 'that' clause is used. 'The board requires that all department heads submit...' is the correct subjunctive construction. 'What' introduces an indirect question or a noun clause about a thing. 'Which' is used for choices. 'How' introduces manner.",
    "response": "---\n**Question 25**\n\nChoose the word or phrase that best completes the sentence.\n\nThe board requires _______ all department heads submit a written summary of their quarterly objectives.\n\n1. what\n2. that\n3. which\n4. how\n\n---\n\n**Answer: 2. that**\n\nAfter verbs like require, demand, insist, and suggest, use the structure: verb + that + subject + base verb (subjunctive). Here: 'requires that all department heads submit.' The conjunction 'that' introduces the noun clause. 'What' would change the meaning to a question about things. 'Which' implies a choice. 'How' describes manner."

    "options": ["will be dispatched", "are dispatching", "dispatched", "dispatch"],
    "answer": "will be dispatched",
    "explanation": "The sentence describes a future action (before 5 P.M.) in the passive voice (shipments are the receivers of dispatching). 'Will be dispatched' is the future passive, which fits. 'Are dispatching' is active present progressive and illogical because shipments cannot dispatch. 'Dispatched' alone is past tense. 'Dispatch' is the base form with no auxiliary.",
    "response": "---\n**Question 26**\n\nChoose the word or phrase that best completes the sentence.\n\nThe logistics coordinator confirmed that all shipments _______ before the warehouse closes at 5 P.M.\n\n1. will be dispatched\n2. are dispatching\n3. dispatched\n4. dispatch\n\n---\n\n**Answer: 1. will be dispatched**\n\nThe sentence is about a future event, and 'shipments' are the receivers of the action (they get dispatched, not do the dispatching). The future passive 'will be dispatched' is correct. 'Are dispatching' is active and illogical for an inanimate subject. 'Dispatched' is past tense. Note that even though the main verb 'confirmed' is past, the embedded clause refers to a future event."

    "options": ["confirmed", "had confirmed", "would confirm", "confirms"],
    "answer": "had confirmed",
    "explanation": "This is a Type 3 (past unreal) conditional, describing a hypothetical situation contrary to past fact. The structure is: 'If + past perfect, would have + past participle.' 'Had confirmed' (past perfect) in the if-clause pairs with 'would not have been delayed' in the main clause. This structure indicates the supplier did not confirm on time, causing the delay.",

The structure is: 'If + past perfect (had confirmed), would have + past participle (would not have been delayed).' This combination signals that we are imagining a different past outcome. 'Confirmed' (simple past) belongs to Type 2 conditionals."

    "options": ["at", "within", "along", "toward"],
    "answer": "within",
    "explanation": "'Within walking distance' is a fixed phrase meaning close enough to walk to. 'Within' expresses inclusion inside a boundary or limit. 'At walking distance' is not standard. 'Along' implies movement beside something. 'Toward' indicates direction of movement.",

'Within' expresses the idea of being inside a limit or range. Other similar fixed phrases: within budget, within reach, within the deadline. 'At walking distance' is not idiomatic. 'Along' suggests movement beside a path. 'Toward' indicates direction."

    "options": ["are", "were", "is", "have been"],
    "answer": "is",
    "explanation": "The subject is 'each,' which is always singular regardless of the noun that follows. 'Each of the candidates' takes a singular verb. 'Is required' is the correct present tense singular form. 'Are' and 'were' are plural. 'Have been' is plural and present perfect.",
    "response": "---\n**Question 29**\n\nChoose the word or phrase that best completes the sentence.\n\nEach of the candidates _______ required to complete a skills assessment test before the final interview.\n\n1. are\n2. were\n3. is\n4. have been\n\n---\n\n**Answer: 3. is**\n\n'Each' is always grammatically singular, even when followed by 'of the candidates' (plural noun). The rule: each, every, either, neither + singular verb. So 'each of the candidates is' is correct. This is a frequent TOEIC trap — do not be distracted by the plural noun in the prepositional phrase. Compare: 'Each student is...' vs. 'All students are...'"

    "answer": "for",
    "explanation": "The fixed phrase is 'praise someone for something.' The preposition 'for' indicates the reason or cause of the praise. 'Praise someone about' and 'praise someone on' are not standard collocations in this context. 'At' indicates location or a point in time, not the reason for an action.",

The preposition 'for' gives the reason for the praise. Similar patterns: thank someone for, congratulate someone on, blame someone for, apologize to someone for. Knowing these prepositional collocations is essential for TOEIC Part 5 success."
